## Overview

Connect WhatsApp to chat with your Inbox Zero assistant using your email account context.

This integration is private by default: only the authorized sender number you configure can use the connected WhatsApp channel.

## Connect WhatsApp

1. Go to **Settings** in the left sidebar.
2. Under **Connected Apps**, click **Connect WhatsApp**.
3. Enter:
   - WhatsApp Business Account ID
   - Phone Number ID
   - Access Token
   - Authorized Sender WhatsApp Number
   - optional Display Name
4. Save.

After connecting, WhatsApp appears in Connected Apps for that email account.

## Chat Behavior

- Send a text message to the connected WhatsApp number.
- Inbox Zero processes the message using your connected email account context.
- The assistant replies in the same WhatsApp chat.

Unsupported inbound message types currently receive:

```text
We don't support this message type yet.
```

## Security Model

- Only the configured **Authorized Sender WhatsApp Number** can trigger assistant actions.
- Messages from other senders are ignored.
- Each WhatsApp number can only be actively connected to one email account at a time.

## Current Scope

In this version, WhatsApp is for assistant chat only.

Not yet supported:
- meeting brief delivery to WhatsApp
- file-filing notifications to WhatsApp
- multi-email unified WhatsApp chat

## Disconnect

To disconnect WhatsApp:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Connected Apps**
2. Click **Disconnect** next to WhatsApp

This stops inbound chat processing for that connection.
