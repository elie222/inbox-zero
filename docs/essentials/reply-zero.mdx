## What is Reply Zero?

The goal of Reply Zero is getting your emails needing a reply down to zero.

Reply Zero will label every email that needs a reply as `To Reply`, and every email where you're waiting for a reply as `Awaiting Reply`.

If you want to see an inbox view where you only see these emails without any other emails, you can use the `Reply Zero` view. But these emails will all be labelled in your regular email client too.

## How to use Reply Zero

<Warning>
  Reply Zero view is not currently available for Microsoft/Outlook users. To see emails needing replies, Microsoft/Outlook users can check the `To Reply` folder in Microsoft/Outlook.
</Warning>

Go to the [Reply Zero](https://www.getinboxzero.com/reply-zero) tab in the left sidebar to enable it.

## How does it work?

### To Reply

Our AI automatically analyzes incoming emails and identifies which ones need your response. These emails will:
- Get labeled as `To Reply` in your email client (Gmail or Outlook)
- Appear in your Reply Zero `To Reply` list
- Be easily accessible in both Inbox Zero and your email provider

### Awaiting Reply

When you send an email that our AI determines needs a response, Reply Zero:
- Labels the thread as `Awaiting Reply` in your email client (Gmail or Outlook)
- Adds the conversation to your `Waiting` list
- Helps you track overdue responses

### One-click Follow-ups

Need to follow up on an unanswered email?
- Use the one-click `Nudge` feature and our AI will draft the perfect follow-up message
- Filter for overdue conversations to prioritize follow-ups
- Send gentle reminders without the awkwardness of crafting them yourself

### Flexible Workflow

Choose how you want to work:
- Use the minimal Reply Zero view within Inbox Zero for maximum focus
- Work directly with email labels (supported in both Gmail and Outlook)
- Reply directly from your email client or within Inbox Zero

## Managing Your Lists

### Mark as Done

When a conversation no longer needs attention:
- Click the `Mark Done` button to remove it from active lists
- Find completed conversations in the `Done` tab

### Filter by Age

Stay on top of older conversations:
- Filter emails by age (e.g., waiting more than a week)
- Focus on overdue threads that need attention
