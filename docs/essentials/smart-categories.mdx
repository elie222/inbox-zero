### How To Use

Sender Categories helps you organize your inbox by automatically categorizing your email senders using AI. Let's walk through how to set it up and make the most of this powerful feature.

#### Setting Up Your Categories

When you first arrive at the Sender Categories screen, you'll see a selection of preset categories that cover common email types like newsletters, marketing, work, personal, travel, and receipts. While these preset categories are helpful, the real power comes from creating categories that match your specific needs.

**Creating Custom Categories**

1. Click the "Add New Category" button
2. Enter a name for your category (e.g., "Team" or "Investors")
3. Provide a description to help our AI understand who belongs in this category

For example, let's say you want to create a category for your team:
- Category Name: "Team"
- Description: "Anyone who emails me from @mycompany.com is on my team"

Or for investors:
- Category Name: "Investors"
- Description: "Any investors I'm speaking to or who have been in touch about investing in my company"

#### Categorizing Your Emails

Once you've set up your categories, it's time to let our AI do the heavy lifting:

1. Click the "Save & Categorize" button
2. Watch as our AI begins analyzing your email senders
3. A progress bar will show you how far along the process is

> **Note:** This process categorizes your email senders, not individual emails. This means once a sender is categorized, all their emails will be associated with that category.

The categorization process might take a few minutes, especially if you have many email senders. Don't worry - this is a one-time process, and you can continue using other features while it runs.

#### Managing Your Categorized Emails

After categorization is complete, you'll have powerful tools at your disposal:

**Bulk Actions**
1. Archive All: Archive all emails from a category
2. Attach Rule: Attach a rule to all emails from a category. For example, you can attach a rule to label and archive all incoming emails from the "Newsletters" category.
3. Use as part of existing rules: You can use a category as part of an existing rule, to either "Match" or "Skip" the rule from being applied to emails from that category.

**Fine-tuning Categories**
If you notice a sender in the wrong category:
1. Find the sender in the category list
2. Click the category dropdown next to their name
3. Select the correct category

#### Advanced Features

**Auto-Categorization**
Want new senders to be automatically categorized? Enable the "Auto Categorize" toggle in the top right corner of the screen. When enabled:
- New senders will be automatically categorized as they email you
- If our AI isn't sure about a category, the sender will be placed in "Unknown"

**AI Assistant Integration**
Sender Categories makes our AI Email Assistant even more powerful:
- Create rules that only apply to specific categories
- Example: Set up automatic replies for "Investor" emails while ignoring "Newsletter" emails
- This makes the AI assistant more predictable and efficient

By using Sender Categories, you'll spend less time organizing your inbox and more time focusing on the emails that matter most to you.
