## Overview

Connect your Slack workspace to Inbox Zero to receive notifications and interact with your AI email assistant directly from Slack. You can get meeting briefings delivered to a channel, receive auto-filing notifications, and chat with the AI by sending it a direct message or @mentioning it.

## Connecting Slack

1. Go to **Settings** in the left sidebar
2. Under **Connected Apps**, click **Connect Slack**
3. Authorize Inbox Zero in the Slack OAuth flow
4. Select which Slack channel to use for notifications

Once connected, you'll see your workspace name under Connected Apps.

## Features

### Meeting Briefing Delivery

Receive your [Meeting Briefs](/essentials/meeting-briefs) in a Slack channel instead of (or in addition to) email.

To set this up:
1. Go to **Briefs** in the left sidebar
2. Under **Delivery Channels**, select your Slack channel
3. Toggle on Slack delivery

Briefings appear as formatted Slack messages with attendee details, meeting links, and key context.

### Auto-Filing Notifications

Get notified in Slack when attachments are automatically filed to your drive. See [Auto-File Attachments](/essentials/auto-file-attachments) for details on setting up auto-filing.

To enable:
1. Go to **Attachments** in the left sidebar
2. Open the **Integrations** section
3. Toggle on Slack notifications

You'll see messages confirming where each file was saved, or questions when the AI needs your input on where to file something.

### Chat with the AI Assistant

You can interact with your Inbox Zero AI assistant directly in Slack:

- **Direct message** the Inbox Zero bot to start a conversation
- **@mention** the bot in any channel it's been added to

The AI assistant has access to your email and calendar context, so you can ask it questions about your inbox, get help drafting emails, or manage your email workflow without leaving Slack.

Conversations are threaded, so you can have multiple ongoing chats.

## Selecting a Channel

After connecting Slack, choose which channel receives notifications:

1. Go to **Briefs** and select a channel from the dropdown
2. The bot will automatically join the selected channel
3. A confirmation message will be sent to verify the connection

You can change the channel at any time. Both public and private channels are supported.

## Disconnecting

To disconnect Slack:
1. Go to **Settings**
2. Under **Connected Apps**, click **Disconnect** next to your Slack workspace

This removes the connection and stops all Slack notifications.
