## Overview

Inbox Zero's calendar integration enables the AI assistant to draft email responses based on your actual calendar availability. This eliminates scheduling back-and-forth by automatically suggesting available time slots or including your booking link in replies.

## Why connect your calendar?

- **Eliminate scheduling ping-pong** - Stop sending emails just to find a time to meet.
- **Prevent double bookings** - AI checks all your connected calendars (work & personal) to ensure you're actually free.
- **Save time** - Drafts intelligent responses in seconds with your specific availability or booking link.

## How It Works

When you receive emails asking about your availability, your AI assistant automatically:

1. **Checks your connected calendars** - Reviews all your linked calendars to understand your current schedule
2. **Identifies available time slots** - Finds open slots that match the request
3. **Drafts intelligent responses** - Creates natural replies with accurate availability information

### Example Scenarios

**When someone asks: "Are you available for lunch tomorrow at 5 p.m.?"**
- The AI checks your calendar for tomorrow at 5 PM
- If busy: Drafts a response like "I have a conflict at 5 PM tomorrow. Would 12 PM or 6:30 PM work instead?"
- If free: Drafts a response like "Yes, 5 PM tomorrow works perfectly for me. Looking forward to lunch!"

**When someone asks: "Can you meet tomorrow?"**
- The AI scans your entire day
- Suggests multiple available time slots: "I'm available tomorrow at 9 AM, 2-3 PM, or after 4:30 PM. Which works best for you?"

## Getting Started

Setting up calendar integration is simple:

1. **Navigate to the Calendars page**
   - Click `Calendars` in the sidebar on the website

2. **Connect your calendar**
   - Click the "Connect Calendar" button
   - Choose between Google Calendar or Microsoft (Outlook) Calendar
   - Authorize access to your calendar
   - Select which calendars you want to sync

3. **Configure your settings** (optional)
   - Set your timezone to ensure accurate availability suggestions
   - Add a calendar link that the AI can include in draft responses

4. **That's it!** Your AI assistant will now have access to your availability when drafting email responses.

<Note>
You can connect multiple calendars - perfect if you manage work and personal calendars separately or coordinate across different organizations.

## Key Features

- **Real-time availability checking** - Always provides up-to-date scheduling information
- **Multiple calendar support** - Connect all your calendars for comprehensive availability
- **Smart conflict detection** - Identifies scheduling conflicts and suggests alternatives
- **Natural language responses** - Drafts replies that sound human, not robotic
- **Privacy-focused** - Only accesses calendar data when needed for drafting responses

## Calendar Support

Inbox Zero supports both **Google Calendar** and **Microsoft (Outlook) Calendar**. You can connect calendars from either provider, or both, to give the AI assistant a complete view of your availability.

## Additional Settings

### Timezone Configuration

Set your timezone in the calendar settings to ensure the AI assistant provides accurate availability suggestions. This is especially important if you work across multiple time zones or travel frequently.

### Calendar Link

You can optionally provide a calendar booking link (such as Calendly, Google Calendar booking page, or Microsoft Bookings) that the AI assistant can automatically include in draft responses. When someone asks about your availability, the AI will include this link in the draft, making it easy for recipients to book time directly.
