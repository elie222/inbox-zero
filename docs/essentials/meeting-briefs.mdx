## Overview

Meeting Briefs automatically sends you an AI-generated briefing before each meeting with external contacts. Each briefing includes context about your attendees pulled from your email history, past meetings, and web research so you're always prepared.

Briefings are delivered to your inbox (and optionally Slack) ahead of each meeting on your schedule.

## What's in a briefing?

Each briefing includes:

- **Attendee profiles** with name, email, and relevant background
- **Email history** summarizing recent conversations with each guest
- **Past meetings** you've had with them
- **Web research** pulling in professional context when available

Internal team members (people on your same email domain) are noted but don't receive individual profiles since you already know them.

Meetings with no external guests are automatically skipped.

## Getting Started

### 1. Connect your calendar

Navigate to **Briefs** in the left sidebar. If you haven't connected a calendar yet, you'll be prompted to connect Google Calendar or Microsoft Outlook Calendar.

### 2. Enable Meeting Briefs

Once your calendar is connected, click **Enable Meeting Briefs** to turn on the feature.

<Note>Meeting Briefs is a premium feature.</Note>

### 3. Configure timing

Set how far in advance you want to receive briefings. The default is **4 hours** before each meeting, but you can adjust this from 1 minute to 48 hours.

### 4. Choose delivery channels

Select where you want to receive your briefings:

- **Email** (enabled by default)
- **Slack** (requires connecting your Slack workspace first, see [Slack Integration](/essentials/slack-integration))

## Upcoming Meetings

The Briefs page shows your upcoming meetings for the next 7 days that have external guests. For each meeting, you can:

- **Send a test brief** to preview what the briefing looks like
- **View send history** to see past briefings and their delivery status

## Briefing Statuses

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Sent | Briefing was delivered successfully |
| Pending | Briefing is being generated |
| Skipped | No external guests found for the meeting |
| Failed | Delivery encountered an error |

## How It Works

1. The system checks your calendar periodically for upcoming meetings
2. When a meeting falls within your configured time window, it gathers context:
   - Recent email threads with each external attendee
   - Past calendar events with the same people
   - Web research about each guest (when available)
3. AI generates a concise briefing with key talking points for each guest
4. The briefing is delivered via your chosen channels

## Tips

- Connect Slack for quick-glance briefings right in your workflow
- Use the "Send test brief" button to see what your briefings look like before your next real meeting
- Adjust the timing to match your prep style. Some people prefer 4 hours ahead, others want it 30 minutes before
