## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) >= 22.0.0
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) >= 10.0.0
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (for Postgres and Redis)

## Local Development Setup

### Option A: Devcontainer

The fastest way to get started is using [devcontainers](https://containers.dev/), supported by VS Code ([Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)) and JetBrains IDEs:

1. Open the project and select "Reopen in Container" when prompted
2. Wait for the container to build and `postCreateCommand` to complete
3. Configure at least one OAuth provider in `apps/web/.env` (see [Setup Guides](/hosting/setup-guides))
4. Run `pnpm dev`

### Option B: Manual Setup

1. **Start PostgreSQL and Redis:**
   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables** using one of these methods:

   **Interactive CLI** (recommended) - guides you through each step and auto-generates secrets:
   ```bash
   npm run setup
   ```

   **Manual** - copy the example file and edit it yourself:
   ```bash
   cp apps/web/.env.example apps/web/.env
   # Generate secrets with: openssl rand -hex 32
   ```

4. **Run database migrations:**
   ```bash
   cd apps/web
   pnpm prisma migrate dev
   ```

5. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

The app will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Configuration

You'll need to configure at least one OAuth provider and an AI provider. The setup CLI handles this interactively, but for manual configuration see the [Setup Guides](/hosting/setup-guides):

- [Google OAuth Setup](/hosting/setup-guides#google-oauth-setup)
- [Google PubSub Setup](/hosting/setup-guides#google-pubsub-setup)
- [Microsoft OAuth Setup](/hosting/setup-guides#microsoft-oauth-setup)
- [LLM Setup](/hosting/setup-guides#llm-setup)

## Local Production Build

To test a production build locally:

```bash
# Without Docker
pnpm run build
pnpm start

# With Docker (includes Postgres and Redis)
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000 docker compose --profile all up --build
```

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="I'm getting rate limited by my email provider">
    This can happen if your email account (Gmail or Outlook) is connected to another service that's making requests.

    To fix this you can check what other services are connected to your email account and remove any that you don't need.

    For Gmail: Visit https://myaccount.google.com/security and check "Your connections to third-party apps & services"
    For Outlook: Visit https://account.microsoft.com/privacy/app-access to review connected apps
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="I'm getting rate limited by my AI provider">
    To solve this you can:

    * Use a different AI model with higher rate limits.
    * Move to a higher tier with your AI provider that has increased rate limits.
    * Slow down the rate at which you are making requests.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Tinybird isn't working">
    Make sure you have the correct region set. You can adjust the region in the `.env` file.
