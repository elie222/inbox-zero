## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) >= 22.0.0
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) >= 10.0.0
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (for Postgres and Redis)

## Local Development Setup

### Option A: Devcontainer

The fastest way to get started is using [devcontainers](https://containers.dev/), supported by VS Code ([Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)) and JetBrains IDEs:

1. Open the project and select "Reopen in Container" when prompted
2. Wait for the container to build and `postCreateCommand` to complete
3. Configure at least one OAuth provider in `apps/web/.env` (see [Setup Guides](/hosting/setup-guides))
4. Run `pnpm dev`

### Option B: Manual Setup

1. **Start PostgreSQL and Redis:**
   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables** using one of these methods:

   **Interactive CLI** (recommended) - guides you through each step and auto-generates secrets:
   ```bash
   npm run setup
   ```

   **Manual** - copy the example file and edit it yourself:
   ```bash
   cp apps/web/.env.example apps/web/.env
   # Generate secrets with: openssl rand -hex 32
   ```

4. **Run database migrations:**
   ```bash
   cd apps/web
   pnpm prisma migrate dev
   ```

5. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

The app will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Configuration

You'll need to configure at least one OAuth provider and an AI provider. The setup CLI handles this interactively, but for manual configuration see the [Setup Guides](/hosting/setup-guides):

- [Google OAuth Setup](/hosting/setup-guides#google-oauth-setup)
- [Google PubSub Setup](/hosting/setup-guides#google-pubsub-setup)
- [Microsoft OAuth Setup](/hosting/setup-guides#microsoft-oauth-setup)
- [LLM Setup](/hosting/setup-guides#llm-setup)

## Local Production Build

To test a production build locally:

```bash
# Without Docker
pnpm run build
pnpm start

# With Docker (includes Postgres and Redis)
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000 docker compose --profile all up --build
```

## Finding Your Way Around

To understand the codebase, we recommend connecting the repo to an AI coding tool like [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code) or [Cursor](https://cursor.com/) and asking questions directly. The [ARCHITECTURE.md](https://github.com/elie222/inbox-zero/blob/main/ARCHITECTURE.md) file provides a high-level overview, though it may not reflect recent changes.

For troubleshooting common issues (rate limiting, OAuth errors, etc.), see the [Self-Hosting Guide troubleshooting section](/hosting/self-hosting#troubleshooting).
