---

There are three ways to deploy Inbox Zero on AWS. Choose the one that fits your team and infrastructure.

| Approach | Best for | Infrastructure |
|----------|----------|----------------|
| [EC2 + Docker](/hosting/ec2-deployment) | Simple VPS-style deployment | Single EC2 instance with ALB |
| [Terraform](/hosting/terraform) | Infrastructure-as-code teams | ECS Fargate + RDS + optional ElastiCache |
| [AWS Copilot](/hosting/aws-copilot) | AWS-native teams | ECS Fargate (managed by Copilot) |

## EC2 + Docker

The most straightforward approach. Launch an EC2 instance, install Docker, and use the same Docker Compose setup from the [Self-Hosting Guide](/hosting/self-hosting). Add an ALB for HTTPS.

Best if you want full control over a single server and are comfortable with SSH.

## Terraform

Generate a complete Terraform configuration with one command. Provisions ECS Fargate, RDS PostgreSQL, optional ElastiCache Redis, and manages secrets via SSM Parameter Store.

Best if your team uses infrastructure-as-code and wants repeatable deployments.

## AWS Copilot

AWS Copilot handles the infrastructure for you. It creates ECS services, load balancers, and networking with simple CLI commands.

Best if you prefer AWS-managed tooling and want to avoid writing infrastructure code.
