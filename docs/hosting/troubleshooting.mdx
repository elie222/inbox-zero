## Viewing Logs

If you installed via the CLI, use the built-in logs command:
```bash
inbox-zero logs            # Show last 100 lines
inbox-zero logs -f         # Follow logs in real-time
inbox-zero logs -n 500     # Show last 500 lines
```

If you're running Docker directly, use:
```bash
docker logs inbox-zero-services-web-1
docker logs inbox-zero-services-db-1
docker logs inbox-zero-services-redis-1
```

## Container Won't Start

Check logs for errors using the commands above.

**Common issues:**
- **Port conflicts**: Another service is using port 3000, 5432, or 6379
  - Solution: Set custom ports via environment variables before starting: `WEB_PORT=3001 POSTGRES_PORT=5433 REDIS_PORT=6381 inbox-zero start`
- **Insufficient memory**: Container is being killed by OOM
  - Solution: Increase VPS RAM or add swap space
- **Missing environment variables**: Check `.env` file exists and has required values
  - Solution: Run `npm run setup` again

## Database Connection Errors

**Error: "Can't reach database server"**
- Wait 30-60 seconds for Postgres to fully initialize
- Check database container is running: `docker ps | grep postgres`
- Verify `DATABASE_URL` in `.env` matches your setup

**Error: "relation does not exist"**
- Migrations haven't run yet
- Wait for web container to complete startup (check logs)
- Manually run: `docker exec inbox-zero-services-web-1 npm run db:migrate`

## OAuth Configuration Issues

**Error: "redirect_uri_mismatch"**
- Your OAuth redirect URI doesn't match what's configured in Google/Microsoft console
- Ensure `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` is set correctly when running `docker compose up`
- Add `https://yourdomain.com/api/auth/callback/google` to authorized redirect URIs

**Error: "invalid_client"**
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` or `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` is incorrect
- Double-check credentials in Google Cloud Console
- Ensure no extra spaces or quotes in `.env` file

## Application Not Accessible

**Can't access via domain:**
- Verify DNS records point to your VPS IP: `dig yourdomain.com`
- Check firewall allows traffic on port 3000: `sudo ufw status`
- Set up reverse proxy (Nginx/Caddy) for HTTPS

**Can access via IP but not domain:**
- SSL/TLS certificate issue
- Use Let's Encrypt with Caddy for automatic HTTPS
- Or set up Nginx with Certbot

## Performance Issues

**Slow response times:**
- Check VPS resources: `htop` or `docker stats`
- Increase VPS RAM if consistently above 80%
- Consider using external managed database services

**High memory usage:**
- Normal for Next.js applications (expect 500MB-1GB)
- If exceeding 1.5GB, check for memory leaks in logs
- Restart containers: `docker compose restart web`

## Rate Limiting

**Rate limited by email provider (Gmail/Outlook):**
- This can happen if your email account is connected to another service making requests.
- For Gmail: Visit https://myaccount.google.com/security and check "Your connections to third-party apps & services"
- For Outlook: Visit https://account.microsoft.com/privacy/app-access to review connected apps

**Rate limited by AI provider:**
- Use a different AI model with higher rate limits.
- Move to a higher tier with your AI provider.
- Slow down the rate at which you are making requests.
