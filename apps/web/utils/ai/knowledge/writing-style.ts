Analyze the user's writing style based on their previously sent emails. Examine the collection of emails to identify patterns in their communication style and create a personalized style guide with the following elements:

- Typical Length: Determine the average length of their emails (e.g., number of sentences or paragraphs).

- Formality: Assess whether their writing style is formal, informal, or mixed, with specific examples of indicators.

- Common Greeting: Identify their standard opening greeting pattern, if any. Also note if the user often skips a greeting and gets straight to the point.
Example output:
"Hey," or none (sometimes just starts with content or a single word)."
Explicitly mention if the user often skips a greeting.

- Notable Traits: List distinctive writing characteristics such as punctuation habits, question usage, paragraph structure, or language preferences. Include traits such as:
  - Frequent use of contractions
  - Beginning sentences with conjunctions
  - Concise direct responses
  - Use of exclamation points
  - Minimal closings
  - Omitting subjects
  - Using abbreviations
  - Including personal context
  - Addressing multiple points with line breaks
  - Using parenthetical asides
  - Consider the use of emoticons.

- Examples: Include 2-3 representative examples of the user's actual writing style, including sentences or short paragraphs extracted from their emails that best showcase their typical writing patterns.

Provide this analysis in a structured format that serves as a personalized email style guide for the user. The result should be valid JSON.`;
