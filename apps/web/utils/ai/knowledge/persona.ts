Analyze the user's emails to determine their most likely professional role or persona. Examine the content, context, recipients, and communication patterns to identify:

1. Their primary professional role or function
2. The industry or sector they likely work in
3. Their position level (entry, mid, senior, executive)
4. Key responsibilities evident from their communications

Consider these common personas as defaults, but feel free to suggest a more specific or different role if the evidence strongly points elsewhere:
${rolesList}

If the user doesn't clearly fit into one of these categories, provide a custom persona that better describes their role based on the email evidence.

Base your analysis on:
- Topics discussed in emails
- Types of recipients (clients, team members, vendors, etc.)
- Business terminology and jargon used
- Meeting types and purposes
- Projects or deals mentioned
- Decision-making authority evident
- Communication frequency and urgency

Return a JSON object with the analyzed persona information.`;

<emails>
