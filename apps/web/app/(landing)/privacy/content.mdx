## Introduction

Welcome to Inbox Zero. We value the privacy of our users and have created this Privacy Policy to explain how we collect, use, and disclose information when you use our Gmail client app. This policy provides details about the data we handle and how we handle it.

## What Information We Collect

### Information You Provide

You may provide us with your email address and other information necessary to access and utilize the Gmail client app.

### Automated Information Collection

When you use our Gmail client app, we automatically collect information about the emails you send and receive. This may include the email address, subject line, and content of the email.

## How We Use Information

We use the information collected for the following purposes:

**Processing Emails**: When using the AI features, we send your email data to OpenAI or Anthropic (AWS Bedrock).

**Storing Planned Responses**: We store our planned responses to your emails within our system. We do not store the emails themselves.

## How We Share Information

We may share the information collected with the following parties:

**OpenAI:** We send email data to OpenAI for AI processing of each email. As per the [OpenAI data usage policies](https://openai.com/policies/api-data-usage-policies), OpenAI will not use data submitted by customers via their API to train or improve their models.
Any data sent through the API will be retained for abuse and misuse monitoring purposes for a maximum of 30 days, after which it will be deleted (unless otherwise required by law).

**Anthropic:** We send email data to Anthropic (AWS Bedrock) for AI processing of each email.

**PostHog:** We use PostHog for product analytics.

## Data Security

We implement appropriate security measures to protect your information. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## Links to Other Websites

Our Gmail client app allows you to send and receive emails that may contain links to third-party websites, products, or services. These links are included in the emails by the senders and are not controlled or monitored by us. We do not endorse, guarantee, or assume responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party websites linked in the emails.

When you access these third-party websites through links in your emails, you do so at your own risk. These sites may have their own privacy policies and terms of use, which we encourage you to review before engaging with the site. Our Privacy Policy does not apply to any third-party websites linked in your emails, and we cannot control or assume responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of these sites.

Please be aware that the information you provide on or through third-party websites linked in your emails is subject to those sites' privacy policies, not ours. We strongly encourage you to read the privacy policy of every website you visit, as their policies and practices may differ significantly from ours.

## Children's Privacy

Our Gmail client app is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child under the age of 13, we will take appropriate steps to remove that information.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page, and we will notify you of any significant changes in the way we treat personal information.
