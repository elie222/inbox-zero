# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: October 31, 2025**

## 1. Important Information and Who We Are

### 1.1 Purpose of This Privacy Policy

This privacy policy aims to give you information on how Inbox Zero collects and processes your personal data through your use of our website, our email automation services, or otherwise when you communicate or interact with us in the course of business. This policy applies whether you connect a Google email account (Gmail or Google Workspace) or Microsoft email account (Microsoft 365, Outlook.com, or Exchange).

### 1.2 Data Controller and Data Processor

**When we act as Data Controller:** For personal data about you as a registered user (your account information, authentication data, usage patterns), Inbox Zero acts as the 'data controller' under GDPR and similar data protection laws.

**When we act as Data Processor:** For personal data contained in your emails and email account information that you submit to Inbox Zero to use our services (such as email content, sender/recipient information, calendar data), we act as the 'data processor' on your behalf. If we are the data processor of your personal data, you (or your organization) are the data controller, and you should contact the controller party in the first instance to address rights with respect to such data.

### 1.3 Contact Details

**Company:** Inbox Zero Inc.  
**Address:** 131 Continental Dr, Suite 305, Newark, Delaware, 19713, United States  
**Email:** [elie@getinboxzero.com](mailto:elie@getinboxzero.com)

**Data Protection Inquiries:** For data protection inquiries, contact us at the email above.

You have the right to make a complaint at any time to your local data protection authority. In the EU, this is your national supervisory authority. In the UK, this is the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) at www.ico.org.uk. We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach a supervisory authority, so please contact us in the first instance.

### 1.4 Changes to the Privacy Policy

If you use our website or services after any changes to this privacy policy have been posted, that means you agree to all of the changes. 

It is important that the personal data we hold about you is accurate and current. Please keep us informed if your personal data changes during your relationship with us.

## 2. The Data We Collect About You

We may create aggregated, de-identified, or anonymized data from the personal data we collect, including by removing information that makes the data personally identifiable to a particular user. We may use such aggregated, de-identified, or anonymized data and share it with third parties for our lawful business purposes, including to analyze, build, and improve our services and promote our business, provided that we will not disclose such data in a manner that could identify you.

We may collect, use, store, and transfer different kinds of personal data about you, which we have grouped together as follows:

**Identity Data:** includes name, username, or similar identifier.

**Contact Data:** includes your email address from your connected Google or Microsoft email account.

**Authentication Data:** includes login credentials, OAuth tokens, and API access tokens for your connected email accounts.

**Email Account Data:** As a data processor, we process email content, metadata (sender, recipient, subject lines, timestamps, folders/labels), and email account settings on your behalf to provide our services.

**Financial Data:** includes payment method details and billing information.

**Technical Data:** includes internet protocol (IP) address, browser type and version, time zone setting and location, browser plug-in types and versions, operating system and platform, and other technology on the devices you use to access our website or services.

**Usage Data:** includes information about how you use our website and services.

**Communication Data:** includes your communications with us (support requests, feedback).

### What We Store and What We Don't

**We do NOT permanently store:**
- Full email content (body text)
- Email subject lines (except as needed for active features)

**We DO store:**
- Sender information (email addresses of people who email you) for analytics and features like bulk unsubscribe
- Summaries and analysis of your email history to provide personalized features and insights
- Email metadata needed for automation rules and account insights
- Temporary email summaries for active features (e.g., digest emails), which are deleted after the feature completes

Email content is analyzed to provide our services but is not retained in our systems beyond what is necessary to deliver the requested features.

## 3. How Is Your Personal Data Collected?

We use different methods to collect data from and about you including through:

**Direct interactions:** We collect the majority of your data through our products and services on our website, by email, or otherwise when you create an account and connect your email accounts.

**Automated technologies or interactions:** As you interact with our website and services, we may automatically collect Technical Data about your browsing actions and patterns. We collect this personal data by using cookies and other similar technologies.

**Third-party or publicly available sources:** We may receive Technical Data from analytics providers such as PostHog. We receive email and calendar data from Google services or Microsoft services when you authorize us to access your account.

## 4. Legal Basis for Processing Your Personal Data

We will only use your personal data when the law allows us to. Most commonly, we will use your personal data in the following circumstances:

- In accordance with the terms of use or service agreement that we have with you (Performance of Contract);
- Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) in the operation of our business and we have made an objective assessment that your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests (for example to manage our relationship with you, improve our services, or respond to your inquiries); or
- Where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation.

Please contact us if you need details about the specific legal ground we are relying on to process your personal data.

## 5. Data Shared with Third-Party AI Models

### 5.1 Data Shared with AI Models

In order to provide email categorization, response generation, and automation features, our service employs machine learning models using third-party AI services. We require our AI service providers to use your information only for the purpose of providing our services. We do not allow those providers to train their AI models using your data.

The following data types may be shared with these AI models:

**Email Content and Metadata:** Email subject lines, email body text, sender and recipient information, timestamps, and folder/label information.

This data is processed for the sole purpose of delivering the AI-powered features you have requested and is not used for any other functions within the AI models.

### 5.2 Zero Data Retention

Our AI service providers have policies that prohibit using customer data submitted via their APIs to train their models. AI providers process data only as necessary to deliver the requested service and do not store your data on their servers beyond what is required for abuse and misuse monitoring.

## 6. Disclosures of Your Personal Data

We may share your personal data with the parties set out below for the purposes set out in section 4 above:

- Our service providers acting as processors who may be based in the US or elsewhere outside the EEA and who provide us with IT support, hosting, data storage, monitoring, analytics, email delivery, and AI language model services.
- Third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer, or merge parts of our business or our assets. Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our business, then the new owners may use your personal data in the same way as set out in this privacy policy.

We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.

## Email Provider API Compliance

## 7. International Transfers

If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), UK, or other jurisdictions outside the United States, your personal data may be transferred to and processed in the United States or other countries where our service providers operate.

Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring that either:

- We have a specific contract in a form approved by the European Commission (Standard Contractual Clauses) which ensures your personal data receives the same protection it has in Europe; or
- Our service providers are members of the EU-US Data Privacy Framework which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between Europe and the US.

Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used when transferring your personal data.

## 8. Data Security

We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect your personal data from unauthorized access, loss, alteration, or disclosure.

We have procedures in place to detect, report, and respond to any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator where we are legally required to do so.

## 9. Data Retention

We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.

To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.

In some circumstances, you can ask us to delete your data (see below for further information).

In some circumstances we may anonymize your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes, in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.

## 10. Your Legal Rights

You have the right in certain circumstances to:

- Request access to your personal data (a "data subject access request").
- Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you.
- Request erasure of your personal data.
- Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms.
- Request restriction of processing of your personal data.
- Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party.

More information on these rights and when they apply is available here: https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/individual-rights/

You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.

We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
