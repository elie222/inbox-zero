# Marketing submodule

This is a submodule for the main repo.
It includes the blog and marketing assets. Self-hosters don't need this in their setup.

To make it work set this as an env var:
GITHUB_MARKETING_TOKEN=

This should be a GitHub access token that only has read.content access to the marketing repo.
