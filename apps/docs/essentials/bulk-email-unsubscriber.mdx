You have a few options to apply to each email with one-click:

- `Unsubscribe` - Unsubscribe from the email
- `Auto archive` - Automatically archive new emails you receive from this sender
- `Auto acrhive + label` - Automatically archive new emails you receive from this sender and label them with a specific label
- `Approve` - This doesn't have any impact on your emails, but will hide the sender from the list (you can view these again by adjusting your filters at the top of the page)

You also have the option to view more details about the sender by clicking the button with an expand icon.
This will show you a graph of how often they send you emails as well as old emails they have sent you.

You can also easily delete or archive emails from the expanded view.

### Ordering

The emails are ordered by the number of emails you have receive from a sender.
You can also order by most unread or unarchived.
This makes it very quick and easy to decide which emails you want to unsubscribe from.
