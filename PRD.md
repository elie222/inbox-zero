# Product Requirements Document: IMAP Integration

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the requirements for adding IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) support to the application. This will allow users to connect their email accounts from any email provider that supports IMAP, not just Gmail. This will significantly expand our user base and make the application more versatile.

## 2. Goals

*   Allow users to connect their email accounts using IMAP.
*   Fetch, read, and display emails from IMAP accounts.
*   Ensure a secure and reliable connection to IMAP servers.
*   Maintain a consistent user experience between Gmail and IMAP accounts.

## 3. User Stories

*   As a user, I want to be able to add a new email account by providing my email address, password, and the IMAP server details.
*   As a user, I want to see all my emails from my IMAP account in the application.
*   As a user, I want to be able to read my emails from my IMAP account.
*   As a user, I want to be able to send emails from my IMAP account.
*   As a user, I want my IMAP credentials to be stored securely.

## 4. Technical Requirements

### 4.1. Backend

*   **IMAP Library:** We will use the `imapflow` library to interact with IMAP servers. It is a modern, promise-based library that is well-maintained and has good documentation.
*   **Authentication:** The application will need to store IMAP credentials (username, password, server host, and port) securely. These credentials will be encrypted in the database.
*   **Email Fetching:** The application will fetch emails from the user's IMAP account and store them in our database, similar to how we currently handle Gmail. This will involve connecting to the IMAP server, selecting the appropriate mailbox (e.g., "INBOX"), and fetching the email data.
*   **Email Sending:** We will use `nodemailer` with the IMAP account's SMTP settings to send emails.
*   **New API Endpoints:**
    *   `POST /api/imap/connect`: To add a new IMAP account. This endpoint will take the user's IMAP credentials, test the connection, and if successful, save the credentials to the database.
    *   `GET /api/imap/emails`: To fetch emails from the IMAP account.
    *   `POST /api/imap/send`: To send an email from the IMAP account.

### 4.2. Frontend

*   **New UI for IMAP:** A new section in the "Accounts" page will be created to allow users to add an IMAP account. This will include a form for the user to enter their email address, password, and IMAP server details.
*   **Displaying IMAP Emails:** Emails from IMAP accounts will be displayed in the same way as Gmail emails, providing a consistent user experience.

## 5. Implementation Plan

1.  **Backend:**
    1.  Add `imapflow` and `nodemailer` to the `package.json` of the `apps/mcp-server` application.
    2.  Update the database schema to include a new table for IMAP accounts, including encrypted credentials.
    3.  Create a new module `apps/web/utils/imap` to encapsulate all IMAP-related functionality.
    4.  Implement the `POST /api/imap/connect` endpoint.
    5.  Implement the `GET /api/imap/emails` endpoint.
    6.  Implement the `POST /api/imap/send` endpoint.
2.  **Frontend:**
    1.  Create a new component for the IMAP account connection form.
    2.  Integrate the new component into the "Accounts" page.
    3.  Update the email display components to handle emails from IMAP accounts.

## 6. Security Considerations

*   All IMAP credentials will be encrypted at rest in the database.
*   All communication with the IMAP server will be over a secure (TLS) connection.
*   We will not log any sensitive user information, such as passwords.

## 7. Risks and Mitigations

*   **Risk:** Different IMAP servers may have different quirks or levels of support for IMAP commands.
*   **Mitigation:** We will start by targeting major email providers (e.g., Yahoo, Outlook) and expand our support over time. We will also implement robust error handling and logging to identify and debug issues with specific IMAP servers.
*   **Risk:** Storing user passwords is a security risk.
*   **Mitigation:** We will use strong encryption for all stored credentials and follow security best practices to protect our database. We will also encourage users to use app-specific passwords where possible.
