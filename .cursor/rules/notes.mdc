- Do not try and run the project via `dev` or `build` command unless I explicitly ask you to.
- Prefer self-documenting code over comments; use descriptive variable and function names instead of explaining intent with comments.
- Add helper functions to the bottom of files, not the top!
- All imports go at the top of files, no mid-file dynamic imports.
- Co-locate test files next to source files (e.g., `utils/example.test.ts`). Only E2E and AI tests go in `__tests__/`.
