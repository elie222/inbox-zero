- Do not try and run the project via `dev` or `build` command unless I explicitly ask you to.
- Prefer self-documenting code over comments; use descriptive variable and function names instead of explaining intent with comments. Never add comments that just describe what the code does - code should explain itself. Only add comments for "why" not "what".
- Add helper functions to the bottom of files, not the top!
- All imports go at the top of files, no mid-file dynamic imports.
- Co-locate test files next to source files (e.g., `utils/example.test.ts`). Only E2E and AI tests go in `__tests__/`.
- Do not export types/interfaces that are only used within the same file. Export later if needed.
- Infer types from Zod schemas using `z.infer<typeof schema>` instead of duplicating as separate interfaces.
- Balance DRY vs WET: Avoid premature abstraction. Duplicating code 2-3 times is often better than creating an abstraction too early. Only extract shared code when you see a clear, stable pattern. WET (Write Everything Twice) code is easier to change than the wrong abstraction. However, obvious copy-paste of entire functions or large blocks should be refactored.
- Do not use the sandbox terminal for npm, git and gh cli commands
