# Wireframes

This directory contains text-based wireframes of different screens in the application.

## Purpose
These wireframes provide structural context to the AI assistant. Passing text-based wireframes is more efficient than passing screenshots and helps the AI understand the UI layout, component hierarchy, and available actions within the project.

## Note on Accuracy
These wireframes are **not** a source of truth. They are intended for context only and may become outdated as the application evolves. Always refer to the actual source code for the most up-to-date implementation.
