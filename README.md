## Getting Started for Developers

### Contributing to the project

We have a public Kanban available [here](https://github.com/users/elie222/projects/1/views/1). Join our [Discord](https://www.getinboxzero.com/discord) to discuss tasks and check what's being worked on.

### Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) >= 18.0.0
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) >= 8.6.12
- [Docker desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (optional)

### Setup

[Here's a video](https://youtu.be/hVQENQ4WT2Y) on how to set up the project. It covers the same steps mentioned in this document. But goes into greater detail on setting up the external services.

The external services that are required are:

- [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
- [Google OAuth](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
- [Google PubSub](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloudpubsub/topic/list) - see set up instructions below
- [Upstash Redis](https://upstash.com/) - you can also use regular Redis with the Docker Compose.
- [Tinybird](https://www.tinybird.co/) - you can run the app without this but some features then will be disabled.

We use Postgres for the database.

You can run Postgres & Redis locally using `docker-compose`

```bash
docker-compose up -d # -d will run the services in the background
```

Create your own `.env` file:

```bash
cp apps/web/.env.example apps/web/.env
cd apps/web
pnpm install
```

Set the environment variables in the newly created `.env`. You can see a list of required variables in: `apps/web/env.ts`.

The required environment variables:

- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` -- can be any random string (try using `openssl rand -hex 32` for a quick secure random string)
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` -- Google OAuth client ID. More info [here](https://next-auth.js.org/providers/google)
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` -- Google OAuth client secret. More info [here](https://next-auth.js.org/providers/google)
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` -- OpenAI API key.
- `UPSTASH_REDIS_URL` -- Redis URL from Upstash.
- `UPSTASH_REDIS_TOKEN` -- Redis token from Upstash.
- `TINYBIRD_TOKEN` -- Admin token for your Tinybird workspace (be sure to create an instance in the GCP `us-east4` region. This can also be changed via your `.env` if you prefer a different region). You can also decide to disabled Tinybird and then the analytics and bulk unsubscribe features will be disabled. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_DISABLE_TINYBIRD=true` if you decide to disable Tinybird.

To run the migrations:

```bash
pnpm prisma migrate dev
```

To run the app locally:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

Or from the project root:

```bash
turbo dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
To upgrade yourself to admin visit: [http://localhost:3000/admin](http://localhost:3000/admin).

### Supported LLMs

For the LLM, you can use Anthropic, OpenAI, or Anthropic on AWS Bedrock. You can also use Ollama by setting the following enviroment variables:

```sh
OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434/api
NEXT_PUBLIC_OLLAMA_MODEL=phi3
```

Note: If you need to access Ollama hosted locally and the application is running on Docker setup, you can use `http://host.docker.internal:11434/api` as the base URL. You might also need to set `OLLAMA_HOST` to `0.0.0.0` in the Ollama configuration file.

You can select the model you wish to use in the app on the `/settings` page of the app.

### Setting up Google OAuth and Gmail API

You need to enable these scopes in the Google Cloud Console:

```plaintext
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.profile
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.modify
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.settings.basic
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/contacts
```

### Setting up Tinybird

Follow the instructions [here](./packages/tinybird/README.md) to setup the `pipes` and `datasources`.

Optional: If you want to store AI usage stats in Tinybird too, then do the same in `/packages/tinybird-ai-analytics`.

### Set up push notifications via Google PubSub to handle emails in real time

Follow instructions [here](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/guides/push).

1. [Create a topic](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/guides/push#create_a_topic)
2. [Create a subscription](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/guides/push#create_a_subscription)
3. [Grant publish rights on your topic](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/guides/push#grant_publish_rights_on_your_topic)

Set env var `GOOGLE_PUBSUB_TOPIC_NAME`.
When creating the subscription select Push and the url should look something like: `https://www.getinboxzero.com/api/google/webhook?token=TOKEN` or `https://abc.ngrok-free.app/api/google/webhook?token=TOKEN` where the domain is your domain. Set `GOOGLE_PUBSUB_VERIFICATION_TOKEN` in your `.env` file to be the value of `TOKEN`.

To run in development ngrok can be helpful:

```sh
ngrok http 3000
# or with an ngrok domain to keep your endpoint stable (set `XYZ`):
ngrok http --domain=XYZ.ngrok-free.app 3000
```

And then update the webhook endpoint in the [Google PubSub subscriptions dashboard](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloudpubsub/subscription/list).

To start watching emails visit: `/api/google/watch/all`
